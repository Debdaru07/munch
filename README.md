This simple app is designed to support our hackathon event at the MSA office by helping developers easily find nearby locations offering pizza and juice, ensuring they stay energized and engaged throughout the day. The app leverages the Yelp API (or a similar API) to locate and display businesses within a specified radius that serve both items.
